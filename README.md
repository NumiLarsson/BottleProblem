# BottleProblem
Code test for Beamon People

The program is built in visual studio, and should compile using any C# .net framework compiler. Contact me if you rather want the .exe or a nuget package.

If you plan to use this anywhere, I suggest improving the tests and restructuring the code a little bit.
